# dugger
inspired by CS50 duch debugger on VSCODE

List of things to edit-add/found bugs
-Need to change input and button position to fixed position and position it bottom of the screen/view [x]not done
-center items/content [x]not done
-add event listener for "enter"/so that button or enter will work [x]not done
-need more aesthetics [x]not done

Future features
- need to turn dugger into extention
- edit local database so that when the extention is minimised or refreshed, the value or saved result will stay on screen
- need to learn how to add timer to the debugger reply. as of for now the reply is instantanious, adding a second or two delay would help for immersiveness or maybe can add random delay time (0-5 seconds)
